-- CUSTOM CRITERIA FOR EVERYONE
-- Compiled and maintained by CMDR Julian Ford
-- v1.2.0

--[[This custom criteria file owes a huge debt to the powerful, charmingly chaotic Magellan Experience 
	custom criteria file, as well as the numerous brilliant coders who submitted their criteria 
	to the Elite Observatory Discord server. Many thanks to those who did so much of the hardest work. 
	Here I have compiled or written what I felt were the most important and/or convenient criteria 
	missing from the Observatory default options, in an organized and well-notated document that should 
	be relatively easy to understand and, if you wish, alter to your taste. Numerous default criteria
	from Observatory Explorer have also been reworked to provide more information in the notification
	card, such as the radius of a Small object, or the surface gravity of a high gravity world.
	
	Extra special thanks to:
	-Vithigar: for developing and maintaining Elite Observatory;
	-Matt G and fjk: for your variety of extensions and criteria, for many very interesting 
	conversations and thought experiments, and for being just so darn friendly and helpful;
	-Eahlstan, DaftMav, Sirob0911, Marty--McFly, Duvel McMuttons, MariettaGecko,  Andrew Gaspurr,
	Arcanic	and many others, for contributing your fabulous custom criteria to the community, 
	and for answering my questions as I figured this out;
	-Griff Rogers, as well as my squadmates in the Astral Survey Project, for early testing and 
	providing valuable critique.

-----GLOBAL SECTION-----

-- [[Here you will find a brief description of each criteria, what requirements the criteria needs to meet in order to trigger, any variables that affect the specifics of how it is triggered, and an option to disable each criteria entirely. All criteria are defaulted to "true" and will trigger unless disabled. If you wish to disable a criteria, simply change the appropriate  "true" to "false". You should pay attention to the instructions and not make edits anywhere 
	except where you are supposed to. If you are concerned you might break the file, back it up before you make a change.

-- 4.3: HORIZONS BIOLOGICAL SIGNALS LIKELY
------------------------------------------
--[[A landable body with biological signals, but no atmosphere, triggers this notification. Since
	landable tenuous atmospheres did not exist in Horizons, but biological signals did, most 
	Horizons-era bios generate on bodies with no atmosphere. This criteria is especially important 
	because currently, BioInsights does not make any effort to predict Horizons-era bios.

------------------------------------
--[[These variables are used in the "landable, close proximity to star" ping.

	-smallStarThreshold: This is a static threshold in LS for small stars, 
	which do not play well with the quotient system. Any landable within this
	distance from a small star (mainly a Neutron or a White Dwarf) will trigger
	this notification.
	
	-baseQuotient: This sets a threshold of relative proximity based on the
	radius of the star and its distance from the scanned body. Basically, if
	you want only closer stars to ping, lower this number, and if you want
	further stars to ping, raise this number.
	
	-atmoBump: This is an optional supplement to baseQuotient, added on if the
	scanned body has an atmosphere. If you want the same relative distance to
	trigger the notification whether the scanned body has an atmosphere or not,
	set this number to 0.

-- 4.6: LANDABLE WITH ATMOSPHERE
